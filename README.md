# CodeClause_Fee_Report
A school fee report Java project on GitHub would likely involve creating a system to manage and report on student fee payments for a school or educational institution. This could include features such as:

A user interface for school staff to add and manage student fee payment records
An interface for generating reports on fee payment activity by individual students, classes, or the school as a whole
Integration with a database or other data storage system to store and retrieve payment records
Implementing authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized staff can access and modify payment records
Providing error handling and validation for inputs and outputs to ensure data integrity and prevent data loss or corruption
